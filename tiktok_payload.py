"""tiktok_payload.py — the two structured sources TikTok's web pages carry.

Why this file exists at all
===========================
TikTok serves three page kinds that this family reads, and they belong to
TWO different front-end applications that spell their state differently:

    /@user                 __UNIVERSAL_DATA_FOR_REHYDRATION__   the main webapp
    /@user/video/{id}      __UNIVERSAL_DATA_FOR_REHYDRATION__   same app
    /embed/@user           __FRONTITY_CONNECT_STATE__           the embed app

CLAUDE.md §23 names this shape on another site: two structured sources
belonging to two different applications. Keeping both readers in one
module is what stops a repo growing two half-parsers that disagree about
what "the payload" means.

This file is COPIED BYTE-IDENTICAL into every tiktok-* repo, and each
repo's smoke suite pins its SHA-256 against a recorded digest. CLAUDE.md
§16's rule is that copied core is untested core; the digest turns a silent
divergence into a red test. When this file legitimately changes, the
digest changes in the same commit, in every repo, or those repos go red —
which is the point.

The one measurement that shapes every reader here
=================================================
Measured 2026-09-22 over 15 captured profiles from a datacentre address:
TikTok publishes each count TWICE, and the two disagree.

`stats` is rounded to three significant figures and rounds BOTH WAYS, so
it is not a floor, a ceiling, or anything a consumer can correct for.
`statsV2` carries the exact figure, as a STRING. Every reader below
prefers statsV2 and falls back to stats only when statsV2 is absent,
recording which one it used — because a number whose provenance is
unrecorded is a guess presented as a fact (CLAUDE.md §8).

# CLAUDE.md §18: count every candidate marker on a page you KNOW is good
# before adding it. Counted 2026-09-22 across the captures in this repo:
#
#     marker              on a served profile   on a shop Security Check
#     "captcha"                          25                  29
#     "slide"                             0                   7
#     "rotate"                            0                  25
#     "secsdk-captcha"                    0                   4

#     "captcha_verify_img_slide"          0                   1
#
# So the bare word `captcha` is a fact about every TikTok page and is
# USELESS as a marker — the exact trap §18 records from another site,
# where `akamai` matched every page the site served. The markers below are
# the ones that scored zero on every served capture.
#
# `rotate` and `slide` are NOT here either, despite scoring zero on the
# profiles measured: they are ordinary English words that a video
# description or a product title can carry, and a marker that a user's own
# text can trip is a marker that will eventually refuse a good page.
#
# The set below is split by what each marker can actually SEE, because the
# challenge reaches a parser two ways and they do not share a vocabulary:
#
#   RAW (an HTTP client, or --dump-html before any script runs)
#       the 5,724-byte interstitial. Counted 2026-09-22:
#           oec-ttweb-captcha     2 on the challenge, 0 on every served page
#           captcha-init          1 on the challenge, 0 on every served page
#       "served page" here is all 15 profile captures, the embed page and
#       the video page.
#
#   RENDERED (a browser, after the widget paints)
#       the slide puzzle itself:
#           secsdk-captcha            0 on served, 4 on the challenge
#           captcha_verify_img_slide  0 on served, 1 on the challenge
#
# A set that carried only the rendered names called the raw interstitial a
# parse error — a served page this parser did not understand — which is
# the wrong advice in a log: it sends the reader to the parser instead of
# to the challenge.
#
# NOT carried: the bare word `captcha`, which appears 25 times on a
# perfectly good profile page and 29 on the challenge. CLAUDE.md §18's
# rule, and the numbers are why: a marker that matches every page is worse
# than no marker.
#
# UNVERIFIED, and stated rather than assumed: CLAUDE.md §24 wants this set
# scored against a page fetched over the 2Captcha Scraping Browser, whose
# auto-solve extension injects captcha hunters into every page it loads.
# That check is written in `smoke_test.py` and SKIPS here, because the CDP
# profiles available while this repo was built had expired (401
# deny_no_user). None of these four names is one the extension is known to
# inject — they are ByteDance's own — but "not known to" is not "measured
# not to", and the skip says so rather than a comment claiming otherwise.

# `oec-ttweb-captcha` WAS in this set and has been REMOVED, and the way it
# got here and the way it left are both worth keeping.
#
# It was adopted on the strength of a count across 25 captures — 0 on every
# served page, 2 on the challenge — and every one of those captures came
# from `tiktok.com`. At the time no SERVED TikTok Shop page existed to
# count it on, because nothing had got past the shop's challenge yet.
#
# Once one did, the count inverted. Measured 2026-09-22 across 5 served
# shop pages and 4 challenge pages:
#
#     marker                      served   challenge
#     oec-ttweb-captcha                5           8   <- fires on both
#     secsdk-captcha                   0          12
#     captcha-init                     0           4

#     captcha_verify_container         0           3
#
# The shop loads its captcha SDK on EVERY page, ready to fire. So the
# loader's name is a fact about the route, not a signal about the
# response — and a scraper carrying it reported exit 3 on a 240 KB page
# holding the product it had asked for. That is CLAUDE.md §18's rule
# ("count it on a page you know is good") failing not because it was
# ignored but because the good page did not exist yet, which is the
# harder version of it: a marker is only as verified as the corpus it was
# counted against, and a new route is a new corpus.
#
# The four kept names are the RENDERED widget — its container, its slider
# image, and ByteDance's SDK class — none of which a page without a
# challenge on it has any reason to carry.

# TikTok's WAF interstitial — the THIRD shape of refusal on this site, and
# the one that is actually curable.
#
# Measured 2026-09-22 on the profile route, `GET /@nasa` with a plain HTTP
# client:
#
#     from this datacentre address (Hetzner, Helsinki)   3 of 3 served
#     from a residential pool, nine exits                2 of 9 served
#
# The other seven answered HTTP 200 with 1,462 bytes whose visible text is
# "Please wait..." and whose body carries TikTok's WAF challenge —
# `SlardarWAF`, a `_wafchallengeid` element and a `waf-aiso/*.js` script.
#
# Two things follow, and the first inverts this family's usual instinct:
#
#   1. A RESIDENTIAL PROXY IS WORSE THAN NO PROXY HERE. 22% against 100%.
#      CLAUDE.md §24 records a site where the gate was the client rather
#      than the address; this is a site where a "better" address is the
#      worse one, presumably because a shared residential pool has been
#      scraped through before and a clean datacentre IP has not.
#
#   2. A BROWSER CLEARS IT. Driving Chromium through the very exits that
#      refused a plain HTTP client: 3 of 3 served, 0 still challenged. It
#      is a JavaScript challenge, not a captcha — there is no widget and
#      nothing for a solver to solve, so `solve` is False in the policy
#      and the remedy is `--transport browser` or a different exit.
#
# That makes `--transport auto`'s fallback load-bearing on this site
# rather than insurance: the engines already switch to a browser for any
# state that counts as blocked, so naming this one correctly is what makes
# the existing machinery do the right thing.
