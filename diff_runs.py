diff_runs.py
-------------
Compares two output files from this project (JSON, as written by
output_writer.save) and reports what changed between them, keyed on `sku`.

    python3 diff_runs.py --old restaurants.2026-09-01.json \\
                          --new restaurants.2026-09-07.json

Typical use is a scheduled re-run kept under a dated filename, diffed against
the previous one:

    python3 playwright_scraper.py --text restaurants --location "New York, NY" \\
        --out "restaurants_$(date +%F)"
    python3 diff_runs.py --old "restaurants_$(ls -t restaurants_*.json | sed -n 2p)" \\
                          --new "restaurants_$(date +%F).json" --out diff.json

Four buckets, each keyed on sku:

  added          — sku present in --new, absent from --old
  removed        — sku present in --old, absent from --new: the listing was
                   filled or withdrawn, or simply fell outside the pages this
                   run fetched
  changed        — sku present in both, with a different title, rate range,
                   pay period, commitment, work arrangement, location, or
                   slot count. See TRACKED_FIELDS.
  source_changed — sku present in both, but one row came from the INDEX
                   (`explore`) and the other from a DETAIL page (`detail`),
                   and they differ on a column only one of the two fills.
                   Reported separately because this says something about our
                   own two snapshots rather than about the listing — and
                   --fail-on-change deliberately ignores it.

TWO THINGS TO KNOW BEFORE READING A DIFF OF THIS SITE
-----------------------------------------------------
**`removed` usually does not mean deleted.** A comments run holds the
first N pages of an ordering, and on a video with two and a half million
comments that is a sample rather than a census. Under `--sort top` the
ordering is a live relevance ranking, so a comment drops out of a
five-page file because something above it gained likes — nothing happened
to the comment at all. Under `--sort newest` the window slides forward as
new comments arrive, and the oldest rows fall off the end of it.

Two runs are comparable as a census only when both covered the same
ground, which on this site means the same ordering, the same `--pages`,
and the same answer to `--replies`. The first is refused outright; the
other two are reported as notes, because a smaller run is still worth
diffing as long as the reader knows what `removed` can mean.

YouTube states its own comment total in the section header, so there IS a
site-stated figure to compare a run against — and the sidecar records it
beside what the run actually collected (`total_comments`,
`comments_collected`, `sample_share_pct`). A five-page run of a video with
two and a half million comments is `complete` and is 0.004% of it.

**`position` and `page` are deliberately not tracked, and here that is a
necessity rather than a choice.** Under `--sort top` the order IS the
site's live relevance ranking: a comment that gains likes overnight moves,
and every comment below it moves with it. Tracking position would report
most of the file as changed every night, and a diff that is always noisy is
one nobody reads.

Under `--sort newest` the order is chronological and much steadier — but a
new comment at the top still shifts every row beneath it by one, which is
the same noise arriving by a different route. So neither ordering makes
position a useful thing to diff, and both make the SORT itself worth
refusing to compare across, which `_runs_are_comparable` does.

A row this project's parser could not recover a sku for (None) cannot be
matched across runs at all, so it is counted and reported separately rather
than silently folded into "added"/"removed", which would be wrong on its face.

# What is worth watching on a comment, and nothing else.
#
# EVERY NAME HERE MUST EXIST ON THE ROW CLASS, and that is not a style
# rule. This tuple arrived from the repo this one was ported from naming
# 25 fields the row class does not have — so the diff compared nothing and
# reported "0 changed" with exit 0 on a run where a tracked value had
# changed. A monitor that cannot see the thing it monitors is worse than
# no monitor, because it reports success. `smoke_test.py` pins every name
# here against the dataclass.
#
# A shop's fields are absent because a comment has no price, stock or
# discount — porting them would be dead code that looks load-bearing
# (CLAUDE.md §4). What changes on a comment is its TEXT (it was edited),
# its ENGAGEMENT, and the badges the creator controls.
#
# DELIBERATELY NOT TRACKED, and each is a measurement rather than an
# oversight:
#
#   `published_time_text` and `published_at_approx` — these move ON THEIR
#     OWN. The site renders a relative string, so a comment that said
#     "3 days ago" last night says "4 days ago" tonight without anything
#     having happened. Measured directly: two runs 88 seconds apart
#     disagreed on three of forty rows ("25 minutes ago" -> "27 minutes
#     ago", "7 hours ago" -> "8 hours ago"). Tracking them would make
#     every nightly diff report most of the file as changed, and a diff
#     that is always noisy is one nobody reads.
#
#   `follower_count`, `likes_count`, `video_count` ARE tracked, and they
#     are the point of this repo. Note that they MOVE: nine refetches of
#     one account within an hour on 2026-09-22 returned 1,785,290 …
#     1,785,310 followers, all different, none wrong. So a diff of two
#     runs an hour apart legitimately shows a delta on almost every row,
#     and `--fail-on-change` on this repo means "tell me when a number
#     moved", not "tell me when something broke".
#
#   `avatar_url` is NOT tracked, and this is the one that would otherwise
#     ruin every diff. TikTok serves avatars from a SIGNED CDN URL whose
#     signature is re-minted per request, so the column differs between two
#     runs taken seconds apart, on every row, while the picture is
#     identical. `avatar_id` — the stable content hash out of the same URL
#     — is tracked instead, and it changes when the account actually
#     changes its picture. CLAUDE.md §24 records a float32 round-trip
#     making two modes disagree on every row; this is the same defect
#     wearing a signature.
#
#   `avatar_expires_at` is not tracked for the same reason: it is a
#     property of the link, not of the account.
#
#   `sec_uid` is not tracked. It is an opaque token TikTok re-issues, and
#     a change in it says nothing a consumer can act on.
#
#   `user_id` is not tracked because it IS the join key (`sku`): a change
#     in it would mean the join was wrong rather than that anything
#     happened.
#
#   `position` and `page` — an artefact of the order --url named handles,
#     not a property of the account.
#
#   `scraped_at` and `stats_source` — the latter drives `source_changed`
#     instead, so a run that read `statsV2` and one that fell back to the
#     rounded `stats` do not report every count as having changed.
