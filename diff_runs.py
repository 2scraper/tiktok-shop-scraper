diff_runs.py
-------------
Compares two output files from this project (JSON, as written by
output_writer.save) and reports what changed between them, keyed on `sku`,
which here is TikTok Shop's product id.

    python3 diff_runs.py --old shop.2026-09-01.json \\
                          --new shop.2026-09-07.json

Typical use is a scheduled re-run kept under a dated filename, diffed against
the previous one:

    # TIKTOK_CDP_ENDPOINT is read from .env, never typed (CLAUDE.md §3)
    python3 playwright_scraper.py --url 1732432759321694958 --out "shop_$(date +%F)"
    python3 diff_runs.py --old "$(ls -t shop_*.json | grep -v meta | sed -n 2p)" \\
                          --new "shop_$(date +%F).json" --out diff.json

Four buckets, each keyed on sku:

  added          — sku present in --new, absent from --old
  removed        — sku present in --old, absent from --new: the listing is
                   gone, or this run's --url did not name it
  changed        — sku present in both, with a different price, discount,
                   sales or review figure, shop statistic or shipping fee.
                   See TRACKED_FIELDS.
  source_changed — kept for the family's output shape. Every row here comes
                   from one source, the product page's loader data, so it is
                   always empty.

ONE THING TO KNOW BEFORE READING A DIFF OF THIS SITE
----------------------------------------------------
**Prices move on their own.** Two fetches of one listing minutes apart gave
100.80 and then 94.81 (README, "Prices move"). A price change reported here
is ordinary rather than alarming.

A row this project's parser could not recover a sku for (None) cannot be
matched across runs at all, so it is counted and reported separately rather
than silently folded into "added"/"removed", which would be wrong on its face.

# What is worth watching on a product, and nothing else.
#
# EVERY NAME HERE MUST EXIST ON THE ROW CLASS, and that is not a style
# rule. This tuple used to be tiktok-profile-scraper's, arriving with the
# copied core and naming 26 account fields `ShopProduct` does not have —
# so the diff compared the title and `video_count` and nothing else, and
# never reported the price change the README says it reports. A monitor
# that cannot see the thing it monitors is worse than no monitor, because
# it reports success. `smoke_test.py` pins every name here against the
# dataclass.
#
# DELIBERATELY NOT TRACKED:
#
#   `site_says_bot` and `site_risk_level` — TikTok's verdict on OUR
#     request, not a property of the product.
#
#   `saving_text` — the site's rendering of `price` against
#     `original_price`, both of which are tracked.
#
#   `image_urls`, `description`, `sale_properties` and the package
#     dimensions — listing content that is better compared by eye than
#     reported on every edit.
#
#   `product_id` is not tracked because it IS the join key (`sku`).
#
#   `position` and `page` — the order --url named products in.
