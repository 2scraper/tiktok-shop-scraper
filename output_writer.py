"""
output_writer.py
-----------------
Shared row model + JSON/CSV writers used by all three engines and the
HTTP path.

One mode, one row shape
-----------------------
    --mode profile   a TikTok account's public statistics and settings

This repo reads one KIND of thing, so it carries one dataclass. Its two
siblings — tiktok-video-scraper and tiktok-shop-scraper — read different
kinds and carry their own, and all three keep the family prefix
`source, scraped_at, url, sku, title` byte-identical and first
(CLAUDE.md §9). `mode` is recorded in the run sidecar anyway, so a
consumer holding three files from three repos can tell them apart without
knowing which repo wrote which.

`sku` is the id, as everywhere in this family: here the account's
permanent numeric id, not its @handle. TikTok lets a user change the
handle and publishes `uniqueIdModifyTime` to say when they last did, so a
diff joined on the handle would report a rename as a deletion plus an
arrival.

Why every count carries its provenance
--------------------------------------
TikTok publishes each account statistic TWICE and the two disagree.
Measured 2026-09-22 over 15 captured profiles:

    account        stats.followerCount   statsV2.followerCount   error
    @tiktok                  95,900,000              95,856,713   +43,287
    @khaby.lame             163,000,000             162,986,107   +13,893
    @nasa                     1,800,000               1,785,290   +14,710
    @charlidamelio          160,200,000             160,206,612   -6,612
    @zachking                86,900,000              86,900,407      -407

`stats` is rounded to three significant figures and rounds BOTH WAYS, so a
consumer cannot correct for it and cannot even tell which direction to
distrust. `statsV2` is exact. Every row records which object it was read
from in `stats_source`, and `diff_runs.py` reports a count difference that
comes with a `stats_source` difference as `source_changed` rather than as
the account having changed — the same argument this family makes for
`price_source` on its shops.

The counts also MOVE. Nine refetches of one profile within an hour on
2026-09-22 returned 1,785,290 … 1,785,310 followers, all different, none
wrong. So a canary asserts a floor and a range, never an equality, and two
runs of this scraper differing by a few hundred followers is the site
working rather than a bug.

Everything below the dataclass is row-class-agnostic: pass `row_cls` so an
empty CSV still gets the right header for the mode that produced it.

    the count is logged rather than quietly applied. Sixty consecutive

    `status` is the field a consumer branches on:

                 pagination genuinely ran out (nothing more existed to get)
      partial  — rows were gathered, then the run stopped early
      failed   — nothing was gathered at all

    `mode` and `source` are recorded because `mode` is not implied by the
    repo: the same output prefix can hold a listings run, a job run or a
    careers run, and those populate different columns — a listings row has
    the site's `domain` and its slot counters, a job row has the company
    website and a currency, a careers row has a department and an Ashby
    apply URL. `diff_runs.py` refuses a pair whose modes or sources differ,
    which matters more here than on most sites in this family: a careers run
    and a marketplace run have NO ids in common at all, so a diff of the two
    would report every row as both added and removed.

    `source` is `youtube.com` on every row of every run. The site answers
    on four hosts and this column names the SITE rather than the host, so
    one value covers all of them; which host a URL was given as is
    recoverable from `url`. It is kept because consumers read these columns
    by name across the family.

    `extra` carries facts about the run that are not about any single row,
    and on this site the most important one is how small a run is. YouTube
    states its own total in the comment section header — 2,457,619 on the
    video used for this repo's fixtures — so `extra` records
    `total_comments`, `comments_collected` and the percentage between them,
    plus `sort`, the `client_version` the run spoke and whether replies
    were expanded.

    That is the only honest way to say what a run holds, because "complete"
    and "exhaustive" come apart badly here (CLAUDE.md §21). A 5-page run
    fetched every page it was asked for and is genuinely `complete`. It is
    also 100 comments out of two and a half million, which is 0.004% — and
    nothing in the row count reveals that.

    `pages_failed` lists the pages that did not yield data, by number.
    `pages_completed` alone was enough only while pages were fetched strictly
    in order, where "3 of 10 completed" could only mean 1-2-3: a count is not
    a description once pages can be fetched independently and page 3 can fail
    while 4 and 5 succeed. Recording the numbers keeps the sidecar honest
    about WHICH part of the catalogue is missing, not just how much.

# last page, and "pagination_exhausted" means the site said so itself.
#
# That is also why this repo cannot plan page URLs ahead (CLAUDE.md §7):
# page 5's token is unknowable until page 4 has been read, so a comments
# run is strictly sequential and `--concurrency` above 1 is refused for it
# with that reason. `--mode video` parallelises across VIDEOS instead,
# which is the unit that actually has independent addresses.
#
# "page_cap_reached" fires when `--pages` runs out with the site still
# offering more, which is the normal end of a run here.
# "page_echo_mismatch" is carried for the family's shared vocabulary and
# cannot fire: this site is never asked for a page by number, so it has no
# number to echo back.
#
# "single_page_route" is what a `--mode video` run reports: one video is
# one response, and there is no second page of it to miss.
#
# Note what it does NOT mean on this site: a `complete` comments run holds
# every page it asked for, which is almost never every comment the video
# has. CLAUDE.md §21 — complete and exhaustive are different words — and
# the sidecar records the site's own total beside the collected count so a
# consumer is not left inferring one from the other.
# `video_unavailable` is in this set, and it has to be. It describes a run
# that ASKED and got a real answer — TikTok returned no video for the id,
# or no videos for the account — so the honest code for a zero-row run is
# 4 ("we asked, and the answer was nothing") and not 5 ("we never got the
# content").
#
# `empty_success` is deliberately NOT in it. That one is TikTok's HTTP 200
# with a zero-length body, which looks like an answer and is a refusal; a
# run that saw only those got nothing and must say so.
#
# Left out, they cost exactly that: measured 2026-09-22, both returned
# exit 5, where the same two URLs returned 4 the day before. The exit-5
# rule that introduced it is right and stays — it keys on `not complete`
# rather than on a list of failure names, precisely so a new reason cannot
# fall silently through to "the catalogue is empty". What was wrong was
# this set, which described only the ways a PAGINATION LOOP can end and
# not the ways a site can answer.
#
# The lesson generalises past these two names: when a rule keys on "is
# this reason complete", every reason has to be classified, including the
# ones that are complete answers about an empty result. A reason nobody
# added here defaults to "we failed", which is the opposite of silent but
# is still wrong.
