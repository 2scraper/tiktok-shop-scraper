Shared row model + JSON/CSV writers used by all three engines and the
HTTP path.

One mode, one row shape
-----------------------
    --mode product   one TikTok Shop product page per row

This repo reads one KIND of thing, so it carries one dataclass,
`ShopProduct`. Its siblings — tiktok-profile-scraper,
tiktok-video-scraper and tiktok-ads-scraper — read different kinds and
carry their own, and all of them keep the family prefix
`source, scraped_at, url, sku, title` byte-identical and first
(CLAUDE.md §9). `mode` is recorded in the run sidecar anyway, so a
consumer holding files from several repos can tell them apart without
knowing which repo wrote which.

`sku` is the id, as everywhere in this family: here TikTok Shop's product
id.

Prices move between fetches: two fetches of one listing minutes apart gave
100.80 and then 94.81. So a canary asserts a range, never an equality, and
two runs differing on price is the site working rather than a bug.

Everything below the dataclass is row-class-agnostic: pass `row_cls` so an
empty CSV still gets the right header for the mode that produced it.
