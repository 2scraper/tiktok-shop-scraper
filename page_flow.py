"""page_flow.py — the retry / solve / blocked decision, as DATA.

Shared by all three browser engines and the HTTP path so they cannot
quietly disagree about whether a response is worth retrying, worth paying
a solver for, or worth reporting as a block. Three copies of that triage
drift, and the drift is silent: one engine reporting exit 3 where its twin
reports exit 0 on the same video (CLAUDE.md §1).

Policy and pure algorithms only. No JavaScript crosses this boundary —
Selenium's `execute_script` takes a function BODY with an explicit
`return` while Playwright and pyppeteer take `() => expr`, so a shared
module that carried a snippet would acquire one driver's dialect. What the
engines share here is a NAME for an operation and a decision about it.

TikTok answers a request six ways
---------------------------------
and five of them want a different response, which is why this module
exists on this site at all:

    content              a product page with a product on it
    product_unavailable  the shop served a page with no product on it
    challenge            the slide-puzzle captcha — the common case here
    empty_success      HTTP 200, content-length 0 — a REFUSAL
    challenge          the slide-puzzle interstitial
    error              an HTTP status the site gave us
    parse_error        a page the site served that we failed to read — OUR bug

`empty_success` is the one a naive engine gets wrong, and it is the
defining shape of this site. Measured 2026-09-22 on the video-feed route
next door, every way it was asked — headless Chromium, headful Chromium, a
Windows user agent, after accepting the EU cookie consent, and through a
residential exit in Peru — TikTok answered:

    HTTP 200   content-type: application/json   content-length: 0

No status to key on, no body to parse, no marker to match. Folded into
"empty" it reads as an account with no data and the run reports exit 0;
named separately it rotates an exit and reports exit 3. This repo's own
route has not produced it, and it is carried anyway, because the cost of
being wrong about it is a silent wrong answer.

`video_unavailable` is the other one. A deleted video, a private account
and an id that never existed all answer HTTP 200 with a full app shell and
an empty `itemInfo` — a real answer to the question asked, not a block.
Reporting it as one sends a user rotating proxies over a video that is not
there.

# stating it here keeps an engine from growing a tile-counting wait that
# measures the wrong thing.

# build artefact and therefore listed AFTER nothing more durable exists;
# `body` is the floor that always matches, which is why the minimum is 1
# rather than the >1 CLAUDE.md §5 requires of a LISTING. A profile page
# holds exactly one account, so "more than one match" is not a thing that
