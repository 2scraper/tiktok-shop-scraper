"""
tiktok-shop-scraper — 2captcha Scraper API edition (fourth engine)

Fetches one page through the 2captcha Scraper API, which renders it on
2captcha's infrastructure and returns the HTML over plain HTTPS.

What this path does HERE: TikTok Shop products.

NOT IMPLEMENTED on this route, and deliberately so. The measured way
past TikTok Shop's challenge is a PERSISTENT Scraping Browser profile that
has already visited tiktok.com; the Scraper API is a different product that
fetches a URL per call. This client therefore refuses with that reason. Use
an engine with --cdp-endpoint.

    python3 scraper_api_client.py --url ...

    # TWOCAPTCHA_KEY and TIKTOK_URL are read from .env, so neither needs
    # to be typed — a secret in argv is readable by anything that can run
    # `ps` (CLAUDE.md §3).
